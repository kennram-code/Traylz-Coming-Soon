            <p><strong>3 &nbsp; SHARING & DISCLOSURE</strong></p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>3.1 &nbsp; With Your Consent.</strong></p>
            <br>
            <p>Where you have provided consent, we share your information, including personal information, as described at the time of consent, such as when you authorize a third party application or website to access your TRAYLZ Account or when you participate in promotional activities conducted by TRAYLZ partners or third parties.</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>3.2 &nbsp; Profiles, Listings, and other Public Information.</strong></p>
            <br>
            <p>The TRAYLZ Service lets you publish information, including personal information, that is visible to the general public. For example:</p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>After completing an order, users may write Reviews and rate trails which will be publicly visible along with profile information that you consented to share publicly in your TRAYLZ account, such as your first name, your review, and location.</p>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <p>If you submit content in a blog or social media post, or use a similar feature on the TRAYLZ Service, that content is publicly visible.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>Based on our legitimate interest to promote the TRAYLZ Service we may display parts of the TRAYLZ Service on sites operated by TRAYLZ’s business partners, using technologies such as widgets or APIs. If your reviews are displayed on a partner’s site, information from your public profile may also be displayed.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Information you share publicly on the TRAYLZ Service may be indexed through third party search engines. In some cases, you may opt-out of this feature in your Account settings. If you change your settings or your public-facing content, these search engines may not update their databases. We do not control the practices of third party search engines, and they may use caches containing your outdated information.</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>3.3 &nbsp; Compliance with Law, Responding to Legal Requests, Preventing Harm and Protection of our Rights.</strong></p>
            <br>
            <p>TRAYLZ may disclose your information, including personal information, to courts, law enforcement or governmental authorities, or authorized third parties, if and to the extent we are required or permitted to do so by law or if such disclosure is reasonably necessary: (i) to comply with our legal obligations, (ii) to comply with legal process and to respond to claims asserted against TRAYLZ, (iii) to respond to verified requests relating to a criminal investigation or alleged or suspected illegal activity or any other activity that may expose us, you, or any other of our users to legal liability, (iv) to enforce and administer our Terms of Service, the Payment Terms or other agreements with Members, or (v) to protect the rights, property or personal safety of TRAYLZ, its employees, its Members, or members of the public.</p>
            <br>
            <p>These disclosures may be necessary to comply with our legal obligations, for the protection of your or another person’s vital interests or for the purposes of our or a third party’s legitimate interest in keeping the TRAYLZ Service secure, preventing harm or crime, enforcing or defending legal rights, or preventing damage.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Where appropriate, we may notify Members about legal requests unless: (i) providing notice is prohibited by the legal process itself, by court order we receive, or by applicable law, or (ii) we believe that providing notice would be futile, ineffective, create a risk of injury or bodily harm to an individual or group, or create or increase a risk of fraud upon TRAYLZ’ property, its Members, Users and the TRAYLZ Service. In instances where we comply with legal requests without notice for these reasons, we will attempt to notify that Member or User about the request after the fact where appropriate and where we determine in good faith that we are no longer prevented from doing so.</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>3.4 &nbsp;  Third Party Service Providers.</strong></p>
            <br>
            <p>TRAYLZ uses a variety of third party service providers to help us provide services related to the TRAYLZ Service. Service providers may be located inside or outside of the European Economic Area <strong>(“EEA”)</strong>. In particular, our service providers are based in Europe, India, Asia Pacific and North and South America.</p>

These providers have limited access to your information to perform these tasks on our behalf, and are contractually bound to protect and to use it only for the purposes for which it was disclosed and consistent with this Privacy Policy.</p>
            <br>
            <p>TRAYLZ will need to share your information, including personal information, in order to ensure the adequate performance of our contract with you.</p>
            <br>

            <br>
            <p>Where permissible according to applicable law we may use certain limited personal information about you, such as your email address, to hash it and to share it with social media platforms, such as Facebook or Google, to generate leads, drive traffic to our websites or otherwise promote our products and services or the TRAYLZ Service. These processing activities are based on our legitimate interest in undertaking marketing activities to offer you products or services that may be if your interest.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The social media platforms with which we may share your personal data are not controlled or supervised by TRAYLZ. Therefore, any questions regarding how your social media platform service provider processes your personal data should be directed to such provider.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Please note that you may, at any time ask TRAYLZ to cease processing your data for these direct marketing purposes by sending an e-mail to traylz.app@gmail.com.</p>

            <br>
            <p>If TRAYLZ undertakes or is involved in any merger, acquisition, reorganization, sale of assets, bankruptcy, or insolvency event, then we may sell, transfer or share some or all of our assets, including your information in connection with such transaction or in contemplation of such transaction (e.g., due diligence). In this event, we will notify you before your personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>3.7 &nbsp; Aggregated Data.</strong></p>
            <br>

            <br>

            <p>We may review, scan, or analyze your communications on the TRAYLZ Service for fraud prevention, risk assessment, regulatory compliance, investigation, product development, research, and customer support purposes. In some cases, we may also scan, review, or analyze messages to debug, improve, and expand product offerings. We use automated methods where reasonably possible. However, occasionally we may need to manually review some communications, such as for fraud investigations and customer support, or to assess and improve the functionality of these automated tools. We will not review, scan, or analyze your communications to send third party marketing messages to you, and we will not sell reviews or analyses of these communications.</p>
            <br>
            <p>These activities are carried out based on TRAYLZ’ legitimate interest in ensuring compliance with applicable laws and our Terms, preventing fraud, promoting safety, and improving and ensuring the adequate performance of our services.</p>

            <br>
            <p>You may exercise any of the rights described in this section before your applicable TRAYLZ Data Controller by sending an email to traylz.app@gmail.com. Please note that we may ask you to verify your identity before taking further action on your request.</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>6.1 &nbsp; Managing Your Information.</strong></p>
            <br>
            <p>You may access and update some of your information through your Account settings. If you have chosen to connect your TRAYLZ Account to a third-party application, like Facebook or Google, you can change your settings and remove permission for the app by changing your Account settings. You are responsible for keeping your personal information up-to-date.</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>6.2 &nbsp; Rectification of Inaccurate or Incomplete Information.</strong></p>
            <br>
            <p>You have the right to ask us to correct inaccurate or incomplete personal information concerning you (and which you cannot update yourself within your TRAYLZ Account).</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>6.3 &nbsp; Data Access and Portability.</strong></p>
            <br>
            <p>In some jurisdictions, applicable law may entitle you to request copies of your personal information held by us. You may also be entitled to request copies of personal information that you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and/or request us to transmit this information to another service provider (where technically feasible).</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>6.4 &nbsp; Data Retention and Erasure.</strong></p>
            <br>
            <p>We generally retain your personal information for as long as is necessary for the performance of the contract between you and us and to comply with our legal obligations. If you no longer want us to use your information to provide the TRAYLZ Service to you, you can request that we erase your personal information and close your TRAYLZ Account. Please note that if you request the erasure of your personal information:</p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>We may retain some of your personal information as necessary for our legitimate business interests, such as fraud detection and prevention and enhancing safety. For example, if we suspend an TRAYLZ Account for fraud or safety reasons, we may retain certain information from that TRAYLZ Account to prevent that Member from opening a new TRAYLZ Account in the future.</p>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <p>We may retain and use your personal information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations. For example, TRAYLZ may keep some of your information for tax, legal reporting and auditing obligations.</p>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <p>Information you have shared with others (e.g., Reviews) may continue to be publicly visible on the TRAYLZ app, even after your TRAYLZ Account is cancelled. However, attribution of such information to you will be removed. Additionally, some copies of your information (e.g., log records) may remain in our database, but are disassociated from personal identifiers.</p>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <p>Because we maintain the TRAYLZ Service to protect from accidental or malicious loss and destruction, residual copies of your personal information may not be removed from our backup systems for a limited period of time.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p><strong>6.5 &nbsp; Withdrawing Consent and Restriction of Processing.</strong></p>
            <br>
            <p>Where you have provided your consent to the processing of your personal information by TRAYLZ you may withdraw your consent at any time by changing your Account settings or by sending a communication to TRAYLZ specifying which consent you are withdrawing. Please note that the withdrawal of your consent does not affect the lawfulness of any processing activities based on such consent before its withdrawal. Additionally, in some jurisdictions, applicable law may give you the right to limit the ways in which we use your personal information, in particular where (i) you contest the accuracy of your personal information; (ii) the processing is unlawful and you oppose the erasure of your personal information; (iii) we no longer need your personal information for the purposes of the processing, but you require the information for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; or (iv) you have objected to the processing pursuant to Section 6.6 and pending the verification whether the legitimate grounds of TRAYLZ override your own.</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>6.6 &nbsp; Objection to Processing.</strong></p>
            <br>
            <p>In some jurisdictions, applicable law may entitle you to require TRAYLZ not to process your personal information for certain specific purposes (including profiling) where such processing is based on legitimate interest. If you object to such processing TRAYLZ will no longer process your personal information for these purposes unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for such processing or such processing is required for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
                Where your personal information is processed for direct marketing purposes, you may, at any time, ask TRAYLZ to cease processing your data for these direct marketing purposes by sending an e-mail to traylz.app@gmail.com.
